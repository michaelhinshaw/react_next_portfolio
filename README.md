# React / NextJs / TailwindCss
## Personal Portfolio 


This is my ever evolving personal portfolio. [Coloring Sounds](https://react-next-portfolio-seven.vercel.app/)  I am going to use this space to 
learn about modern web development and share my journey along the way.  Tailwind CSS was used to create this page, with the objective
being to learn an ultra-modern styling practice.  I absolutely love React.  This is the beginning 
of a much larger project that will involve a DIY blog/diary of my journals as a non-traditional self-taught 
learner in programming and music.  I hope to create web tools using modern frameworks that will create access to 
music theory and sound design principles available to anyone with a browser, and in the process break down barriers
to access for these practices for people like me who must learn, but cannot afford the traditional means.

Thanks for visiting, this will be ever evolving.
